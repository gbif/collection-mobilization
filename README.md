## Labelling guidelines

[to be defined/updated]

* Add the `registered publisher` label if the institution is registered on GBIF.
* Add the `some specimens in GBIF` label if the institution (or a third party) has already published some of the institution's specimens on GBIF.
* Add the `collection missing from GBIF` label if some of the collections aren't available on GBIF yet.
    * Add the `some digitised specimens-metadata missing from GBIF` label if the institution has somthing almost like occurrences (scientific name, location, date) available like a database or online inventory for their specimens.
        * Add the `media available` label if the institutions has specimen-related media or is in the process of getting media (e.g. capturing images).
* Add the `outside of GBIF scope` label if the institution has only collections that wouldn't fit in GBIF (like geology or archeology collections)
* Add the `pending collection verification` label if initial search shows no indication of collection curation.
