## Labelling guidelines

[to be defined/updated]

* Add the `registered publisher` label if the institution is registered on GBIF.
* Add the `some specimens in GBIF` label if the institution (or a third party) has already published some of the institution's specimens on GBIF.
* Add the `collection missing from GBIF` label if some of the collections aren't available on GBIF yet.
* Add the `digitized specimens missing from GBIF` label is some of the digitized specimens aren't available on GBIF.
* Add the `outside of GBIF scope` label if the institution has only collections that wouldn't fit in GBIF (like geology or archeology collections)
